Motion - A Notes App

Motion is a React application that aims to provide users with a flexible and intuitive note-taking experience, inspired by the popular app Notion. This project leverages React's component-based architecture and modern web technologies to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Features
Create and Organize Notes: Users can create new notes and organize them into customizable categories or folders for easy navigation and management.

Rich Text Editing: Motion allows users to format their notes using a variety of text styling options, such as bold, italic, underline, bullet points, and headings. Users can also embed images and links within their notes.

Collaborative Editing: Motion supports real-time collaborative editing, allowing multiple users to work together on the same note simultaneously. Changes made by one user are instantly reflected for others.

Flexible Layouts: Motion provides a flexible and customizable layout system, enabling users to arrange and organize their notes in different ways. Users can choose between grid or list view and resize note cards according to their preference.

Tagging and Filtering: Users can assign tags to their notes and easily filter and search for specific notes based on tags, categories, or keywords.

Technologies Used
Motion is built using the following technologies and libraries:

React: The core framework used for building the user interface and managing the state of the application.

React Router: Used for handling routing within the application and enabling navigation between different views.

React Quill: A rich text editor component that provides the text formatting functionality for note creation and editing.

Firebase: The Firebase platform is used for real-time data synchronization, authentication, and storage of notes and user information.

CSS Modules: CSS Modules are used to style the application, providing scoped CSS to avoid naming conflicts and improve modularity.
